# The Death Game (Linux Bash Edition)

> "One wrong guess, and your system meets its end."

This is a *practice-only*, high-risk Bash script that simulates a game of luck‚Äîguess the right number and you survive. Guess wrong, and... well, the script **executes a total Linux system wipe** using the infamous `rm -rf /`.

**This script is for educational purposes ONLY. DO NOT run this outside a secure virtual environment.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

> **This is a system-destroying script.**

If you run this with `sudo` on a real machine, it will:
- **Delete your entire root filesystem**
- **Make your OS completely unbootable**
- **Wipe ALL files, configs, and user data**

‚ö†Ô∏è **I take no responsibility for any damage caused. Run at your own risk.**  
**DO NOT test this on your main OS. Use a Virtual Machine only.**
